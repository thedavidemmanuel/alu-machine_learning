# Error Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on error analysis in machine learning models. Specifically, it involves creating and analyzing a confusion matrix to understand the performance of a classification model. By examining the confusion matrix, you can identify where your model is making errors and understand the types of errors it is making.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Understand and create a confusion matrix.
- Explain Type I and Type II errors.
- Calculate and interpret sensitivity, specificity, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Understand the concepts of bias, variance, irreducible error, and Bayes error.
- Approximate Bayes error and calculate bias and variance.
